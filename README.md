# RFReader-Tools
Software for managing a RF temperature SAW-based control complex.
This software is used to maintain test and stable features of controling a RF temperature control complex.
The complex is configurable but basically consists of RF Reader device and a number of SAW-resonator tags.
This software is capable of full hardware control (direct freq-sweep manageing, attenuation manageing, amplifiers and LNA manageing) 
so as providing a digital signal processing and data visualisation (received signal, it's spectre, current temperature measured by the complex).
